# Zsh PATH config (.zshpathrc)
# All PATH changes are centralized here for clarity.

# --- Homebrew setup (must be first) ---
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

# --- Development tools (higher = higher priority) ---
# Cursor IDE CLI
export PATH="/Applications/Cursor.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin:$PATH"
# Ollama AI CLI
export PATH="/Applications/Ollama.app/Contents/Resources:$PATH"

# --- Programming language runtimes ---
# PHP 8.3 (Homebrew)
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/php@8.3/8.3.24/bin:$PATH"

# --- Debugging (uncomment to use) ---
# echo "PATH loaded from .zshpathrc"
# echo "Current PATH: $PATH"

# --- Notes for future additions ---
# - Add preferred tools last for higher priority
# - Group related tools
# - Use clear comments
# - Test in new shell
# Examples: nvm, pyenv, rbenv, cargo, aws, etc.

# --- Aliases ---
alias ls='ls --color'      # colored ls
alias python='python3'     # python = python3
alias pip='pip3'           # pip = pip3
